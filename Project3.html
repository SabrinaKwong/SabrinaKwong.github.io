  <h1>Net Art Piece <em> Different Coordinates </em>

  </h1>
  <p>For my Project 3 idea, I was inspired by the net art example "My Boyfriend Came Back from the War", by Olia Lialina, and its use of narrative through using links and gifs. I then created interaction through the use of clicking on images,
    text, and a gif, similar to Lialinaâ€™s piece.

    For my use of narrative, I will instead use a story of being in a foreign country and used a different color scheme. My vision for the piece was to bring my personal experience living in China despite language barriers by incorporating the language.
