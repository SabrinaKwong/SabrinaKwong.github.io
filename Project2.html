  <h1>Projection Idea for Project 1</h1>
  <p>For my Project 2, I envision my "Follow" video to be played in a TV monitor integrated with a sculpture of a DLSR body where the monitor i. I intend to make the experience to feel intimate with what is being
    shown and would also like to provide headphones for viewers to channel out outside noise as if one is focusing and recording another person. Since I have the same content from project 2, except played in a loop and in around under 3 minutes, I
    have the similar intention of questioning the act of watching another person. Although it relates to the topic of surveillance, I want to focus more on the act of recording and or watching the recording of someone of them either knowing it or
    not.

  <p>I also want to add on to where the viewing of this piece could be located. I want to envision a rather medium sized room with the TV monitor close to the back wall with dim lighting. Although I have not created my DSLR frame around the TV
    monitor to be more 3 dimensional, I intended it to have a bit more depth in the body create a rather large "camera monitor." The monitor being inside the camera for watching a recording is rather straightforward and I think it fits my theme as
    it could be seen in the footage and incorporates sculpture in an immersive environment.
