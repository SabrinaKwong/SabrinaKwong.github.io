      "Mediation", Illustration, Adobe Illustrator, 2015
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of my first illustration pieces I created in Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to convey a mushroom, a symbol of the looking at the past in the third person. Almost as if one was a spectator.

     <p> "Different Coordinates", Net Art, 2018
     </p>
    <p> This net art piece is a interactive narrative to my experience of living in a China and not knowing the language. </p>

    <p>
      "Thump", Video, Illustration and Afteraffects, 2019
    </p>
    <p> I created this piece with the mind of having projected as a loop on a large projector. I wanted to communicate the feeling of walking through how I feel when I do not walk. I find my body struggling to handle stress and a bit anxious where walking or movement helps balance the chemicals in my brain and found also good for physical health. Therefore, in this piece, I hope to communicate the seperation of the shoe and the sound of a heartbeat as a map in haveing purpose in moving.

     <p>
       "Stella and the Flower", Stop Motion, Adobe Premiere, 2017
     </p>
    <p>
      This is my first stop motion narrative piece titled "Stella and the Flower". It is the story of a picture frame that wants to help a fellow plant besides it.

    <p> "Follow", Videoart, AdobePremiere, 2018 </p>

    <p> "Follow" is a video art piece that digs into what it is like being followed and recorded. Whether it is being 'followed' online and social media or in person- what is one's reaction and thoughts to the act of recording? How do people respond
      to watching someone being recorded? Has it been so normal that we are so comfortable with every moment of it and what are the circumstances one finds it to be inappropriate?

  </p>
  <p>"Info", Video of Processing, Processing, 2019
  </p>
    <p> This my exploration of creative code as a being new to the Processing language. I really enjoyed understanding different commands through trial and error. This piece is called "Info" through my experience of creating this piece becuase of my
      experience of learning how to create this piece.

    <p> "Convergence Through Movement", Videoart, AdobePremiere, 2018 </p>
    <p>
      In a reflective way, “Convergence Through Movement” explores movement through dance. Inspired by other works of video that express similarities, this piece hopes to provide beauty in expressing oneself through one’s relationship with one’s
      body. Where all our movements are tied to the embodiment of oneself, why should we not understand the extension of what our bodies are capable of doing: dancing

  <p>    Piece no.8</p>

  <img src="images/glitchfeet.jpg" alt="Feets" width="670" height="510">
    <img src="images/glitchfoot.jpg" alt="foot" width="670" height="470">
    <p>
      "Beyond Your Feet", Glitch Art, notepad++ (on the left) and Audacity and Photoshop (on the right), 2019
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted the photos to represent pain and restriction with fluidity, feeling present, and freedom. The question or thought I want to address with these two photos would then be what is restricting us from moving and being free? What pains the
      very feet we stand on (for instance, a hairstylist who stands many hours a day compared to someone who sits for many hours a day)? What would we need to be truly free?
    </p>

    <strong>
    <p>  Piece no.9  </p>
    </strong><p> "We are different", illustration/animation, Adobe Illustrator and AdobeAfter Affects, 2019</p>
    <img src="images/difference.jpg" alt="Feets" width="500" height="310">
<p> I was part of the Gender Equity Center's Gender and Body Positivity Art Gallery and displayed one goache painting and this digital video pieces that were projected on two screens. My video piece was syned as a loop in a beat that played pretty well with the background music. This is an ongoing piece of different women and their body types. Accepting themselves through the use of light colors as we all as presenting them to the big world. </p>

    <p>   Piece no.10   </p>
     </strong>
    <img src="images/wholesome.jpg" alt="wholesome" width="500" height="410">
    <p> "Spread the Love", Meme, Photoshop and Illustrator, 2019</p>

    <p>
      I mashed up a meme in my art 75 class that aimed towards positivity and wholesomness. I created this with Fred Rogers, Kermit the frog, hearts, and the cutie pie memes and images in mind to create a mashup that I can share and give a smile for someone else's day.
