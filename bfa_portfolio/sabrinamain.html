    Artist Statement
</p>
  </strong>
  <p>
    I am a Chinese American artist, a designer, and creative problem solver. As someone who experienced a lot health problems, I am interested in self care and awareness of one’s physical body.
    I hope to explore how a body moves through space and do so with digital mediums.
    Looking what is currently happening with technology with an influence of the past helps me understand where I am heading in to the future.

<p> "Follow", videoart, AdobePremiere </p>

 <p> "Follow" is a video art piece that digs into what it is like being followed and recorded, whether it is being 'followed' online and social media or in person, what is one's reaction and thoughts to the act of recording? How do people respond to watching someone being recorded? Has it been so normal that we are so comfortable with every moment of it and what are the circumstances one finds it to be inappropriate?

  <p> "Convergence Through Movement", Videoart, AdobePremiere </p>
    <p>
 n a reflective way, “Convergence Through Movement” explores movement through dance. Inspired by other works of video that express similarities, this piece hopes to provide beauty in expressing oneself through one’s relationship with one’s body. Where all our movements are tied to the embodiment of oneself, why should we not understand the extension of what our bodies are capable of doing: dancing

  <p> Piece no.8</p>
<p>
"Beyond Your Feet", glitch art, notepad++ (on the left) and Audacity and Photoshop (on the right)
</p>
<p>
 < I wanted the photos to represent pain and restriction with fluidity, feeling present, and freedom.  The question or thought I want to address with these two photos would then be what is restricting us from moving and being free? What pains the very feet we stand on (for instance, a hairstylist who stands many hours a day compared to someone who sits for many hours a day)? What would we need to be truly free?
