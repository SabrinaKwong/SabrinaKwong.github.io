  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>


  <p>
    As someone who has lived outside of the United States at a young age for a long period of time and then returning, I have the opportunity to experience another culture and language that gave me a different perspective. I then want to continue my studies in art and technology in order to further share that perspective as well as the story of others in order to create empathy and an understanding of social issues.

  </p>
  <p>
    I believe the tools I learn from  DMA will help me reach that goal and my goal of teaching others to do the same. I create art as a means of self-healing and to further understand topics I am interested in or find challenging to understand.

  </p>
  <p>
    Through this interest of self-care and awareness of oneâ€™s physical body, I have leaned towards creating artwork of understanding my past, how a body moves through space and creating perspective through narratives. My belief towards art is that it should not only be for aesthetic reasons but for a cause, a belief worth contributing to and a way to make others think.

  </p>
  <p>
    I hope to create creative work in all form of mediums that is demanded by the work field and hope to become a become better communicator, whether through a screen or in person.
