  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p> In a reflective way, “Convergence Through Movement” explores movement through dance. Inspired by other works of video that express similarities, this piece hopes to provide beauty in expressing oneself through one’s relationship with one’s body. Where all our movements are tied to the embodiment of oneself, why should we not understand the extension of what our bodies are capable of doing: dancing.
