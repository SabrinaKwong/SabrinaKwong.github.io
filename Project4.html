  <h1>"Convergence Through Movement"</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p> In a reflective way, “Convergence Through Movement” explores movement through dance. Inspired by other works of video that express similarities, this piece hopes to provide beauty in expressing oneself through one’s relationship with one’s body. Where all our movements are tied to the embodiment of oneself, why should we not understand the extension of what our bodies are capable of doing: dancing.

  </p>

  <p> For my final project, I wanted to explore movement compared to stiffness and one’s relationships to one’s body. Therefore, I wanted to make a video of me dancing, but with multiple shots that resemble chronophotography to emphasize and explore movement.

 Since I have been inspired by Remi Weekes et Luke White, "Seaweed" and “ Choros” by Michael Langan & Terah Maher; I wanted to create a video that makes someone think about movement.
