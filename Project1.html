  <h1>"Follow"</h1>

  <h2> I told them to walk for around 10 seconds or until I said 'okay' and have them react to a person recording them. The the prompt for them turning may seem a bit a bit vague, but it was this uncertainty that I aslo wanted to convey in my
    digital art piece called "Follow" </p>


    <p> For my first project, I chose the topic of surveillance for Video as a Cultural critque project. I incorporated shots of the back of heads turning at the end of the video. Different facial reacted to the person being filme as I wanted to
      show what video can do to capture a human moment, no matter how eerie is might seem. Addtionaly, I wanted to show the video's role in a normal setting and apply the trend of surveillance in a poigant and abstract way. It is then up to the
      viewer how they feel when observing the act of watching someone.I was inspired by Pipilotti Rist', a visual artist, and her usage of creating a uncomfortable seeting that could possibly present a narration. I then experimented with the use of
      pace, sound and shots. Eventually, I had many shots of different people in different settings or a similar setting as the camera follows him, her or them.

    <p> "Follow" is a piece that digs into what it is like to being followed and recorded, whether it is being 'followed' online and social media or in person, what is one's reaction and thoughts the act of video? How do people respond to watching
      someone being recorded? Has it been so normal that we are so comfortable with every moment of it and what are the circumstances one finds it to be inappropriate? </p>
