  <h1>Project 1</h1>

  <h2> I told them to walk for around 10 seconds or until I said 'okay' and have them react to a person recording them. The prompt then may have seemed a bit vague for the actors (classmates and strangers), but it was this uncertainty that I aslo wanted to convey in my
    digital video art piece called "Follow" </h2>


    <p> For my first project, I chose the topic of surveillance for Video as a Cultural critque project. I incorporated of approximately 32 shots of the back of the heads of people and having them turm towrds the camera towards at the end of the video. Different facial reactions were recorded as I wanted to
      show what video can do in capturing a human moment, no matter how eerie is might seem. Addtionaly, I wanted to show video's role in a normal setting and apply the trend of surveillance in a poigant and abstract way. It is then up to the
      viewer how they feel when observing the act of watching someone. I was inspired by Pipilotti Rist', a visual artist, and her usage of creating a uncomfortable seeting that could possibly present a narration. Therefore, I experimented with the use of
      pace, sound and distance. Eventually, many shots of different people in different settings or similar settings were shot as the camera follows him, her, or them.

    <p> "Follow" is a piece that digs into what it is like being followed and recorded, whether it is being 'followed' online and social media or in person, what is one's reaction and thoughts to the act of recording? How do people respond to watching
      someone being recorded? Has it been so normal that we are so comfortable with every moment of it and what are the circumstances one finds it to be inappropriate? </p>
