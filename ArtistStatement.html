  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

  <p class= "big">QR stands for quick-response and was used by the Japanese in the factories of the early 1990s. Interestingly, it is also the trademark for Denso Wave Incorporated, which is from the DENSO Corporation, a global automotive components manufacturer of Japan. My vision for this project stemmed from my curiosity about the culture of information and existing knowledge of QR codes. I wanted to know more about QR codes and how they seem to exist in many places in the physical world on paper and the digital world on a phone screen. Like many other ideas that I find relevant culturally as a Chinese-born American as well as a consumer of media, I wanted to understand the ideas through research and creating work. Hence, for the making of my final project and the drafting of several concepts for what I have researched upon, I decided to think differently about our previous self-portrait code assignment. Instead of a portrait of a face, I wanted to create a portrait through a series of illustrations and photos that I have accumulated over the years in Google Photos. I wanted to explore the use of such code generated information as an act of searching for something in digital space. I believe that there should be many wonders for existing objects that surround us and their roles in our everyday lives. As an artist that wants to create a connection of oneâ€™s work to the viewer, making use of emerging technologies in order to create such artwork is also part of these curious feats.
