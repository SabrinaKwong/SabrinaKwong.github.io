  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

  <p class= "big">My name is Sabrina Kwong, a Chinese American and I am part of the human race. I am an artist, a designer, and creative problem solver and currently a DMA major at San Jose State University. Surveillance, personal anecdotes, and movement of one's body are the subjects that I have explored in my digital video art class. After understanding more about the course subject, I hope to adventure and understand more about what is currently happening and what has happened in the past. Giving a different perspective to my audience is my motive as well as having others step in other's shoes is what I care about. Human emotions and what it means being human is something I am interested in as well as questioning what seems ordinary are great feats to chase in my journey as an artist.  Won't you come with me as I learn, grow, create, and unravel a world of discovery?</p>


  <p class= "big">As a constant consumer of the media, an observer of thoughts and even an observer of people walking on the streets, I find that one of the best ways to get an outcome is to experiment and receive feedback. I jot down ideas and put them to action through filming and editing and see what the results are and what I can do to change them. I tend to look for sources online for inspiration or explore a raw idea that could be formulated after much trial and error and thought. What I also like to add to making content and creating a project is to be curious about known subjects. Incorporating previous knowledge also helps to build and inspire a piece one wants to achieve. Finding time to explore, adventure and think about one's work is crucial in creating work that one knows will give at least some impact if not for others, but for oneself.
